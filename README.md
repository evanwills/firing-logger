# Firing logger

(Progressive Web App)

The primary purpose _Firing logger_ is to (manually) log temperatures throughout the course of a kiln firing. With the logged data, the app displays statistics for the firing and compares the logged data to the expected values for the set firing program.

When this app launches, you will be able to enter firing programs and manually log kiln readouts. You'll be able to view pass firing logs and compares firing.

The next feature will be making it possible to use the devices camera to capture the display of the kiln's controller and read the kiln's temperature without the need for a human to enter it manually

In the future, the app will be able to manage all aspects of kiln usage including planning for firing, managing kiln maintenance.
